# LitPublish: Domain-Driven Design Sample Project

![DomainDriven](../../assets/logo.png)
LitPublish is a sample C# project illustrating the application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to a fictitious online publishing platform. The platform enables authors to self-publish, manage digital and print editions, track sales, and interact with readers. It also provides a marketplace for readers to purchase books and subscribe to authors or genres.
